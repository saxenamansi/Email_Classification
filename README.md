# Email_Classification
A spam and non spam emails filters implemented by basic python and ML concepts


**Machine Learning Basics - Email Classification using self defined functions**

1. The aim of this activity is to understand the machine learning classification with email  data set. You need to prepare the email data set from your mail box (randomly)  for both spam (5) and normal emails (5) - Minimum of 10 emails with labels.  Apply your user defined functions for Stop words and Punctuation Removal, Lemmatization. 
2. Generate the Feature Set  for training your model for available classifiers in NLTK Library.
3. Justify the suitable classifier for your dataset based on Accuracy and other parameters (If Applicable)

**EmailClassifier with nltk predefined functions:**

The aim of this activity is to use and familiar with NLTK predefined functions. Convert your Email classification  program with same data set with NLTK predefined functions and try different classes and methods available in it.

1. Use Stop Word Removal Predefined Functions.  Learn to extend the stop words as per your Data Set\
2. Tokenize the sentence using NLTK Predefined function.
3. Use Different Stemmer Classes and find which one is suitable for your Data Set
4. You can also use Part of Speech Tag for effective Stemming for your Data Set
5. As usual, you can use the classification algorithm like previous activity.
 
Note: Do not use any of your user defined functions which you have implemented for previous activity.
